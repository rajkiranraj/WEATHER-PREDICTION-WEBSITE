    <h2>WEATHER PREDICTION HISTORY:</h2>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
</div>
<div class="hover-effect">
    <p>The first ever daily weather forecasts were published in The Times on August 1, 1861, and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year.In 1911, the Met Office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission. These included gale and storm warnings for areas around Great Britain.In the United States, the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by Edward B. "E.B." Rideout, on WEEI, the Edison Electric Illuminating station in Boston.Rideout came from the U.S. Weather Bureau, as did WBZ weather forecaster G. Harold Noyes in 1931.In the early 19th century, British Royal Navy officer Sir Francis Beaufort developed the wind force scale to classify wind speeds.</p>

    <h2>FORECASTING THE SKIES:</h2></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="baddu">
    <p>Meteorology is the science that deals with the atmosphere and its phenomena, including both weather and climate. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. It is an essential part of meteorology, and it involves the use of various tools and techniques to make accurate predictions. Here are some ways meteorologists forecast the skies:</p>
    <br><ul>
        <li><b>Observations:</b> Meteorologists use various tools to measure atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, wind, and humidity. These measurements are used to create a picture of the current state of the atmosphere, which is then used to make predictions about future weather conditions.</li><br>
        <li><b>Numerical models:</b> Meteorologists use computer models to simulate the behavior of the atmosphere. These models use mathematical equations to predict how atmospheric conditions will change over time. The models take into account various factors such as temperature, pressure, and humidity to make predictions.</li><br>
        <li><b>Weather balloons:</b> Weather balloons are used to measure atmospheric conditions at high altitudes. They carry instruments that measure temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are used to create a profile of the atmosphere.</li><br>
        <li><b>Satellites:</b> Satellites are used to monitor atmospheric conditions from space. They provide meteorologists with information about cloud cover, temperature, and other atmospheric conditions that are used to make predictions.</li><br>
        <li><b>Doppler radar:</b> Doppler radar is a tool that uses radio waves to detect precipitation and measure wind speed and direction. Meteorologists use this tool to track the movement of storms and predict their path.</li><br>
        <li><b>Historical data:</b> Meteorologists use historical data to identify patterns and trends in weather conditions. This information is used to make predictions about future weather conditions.</li>

    <h2>HOW CAN ACCURATE FEATURE WEATHER PREDICTIONS SAVE HUMAN LIFE:</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="baddu">
    <br>
    <p>It is well-known that accurate weather predictions can help save human lives by allowing people to prepare for and respond to <br>severe weather events. For example, if a hurricane is predicted to hit a certain area, people can evacuate or take other necessary precautions to protect themselves and their property. Similarly, if a heatwave is predicted, people can take steps to stay cool and avoid heat-related illnesses. Accurate weather predictions can also help emergency responders prepare for and respond to natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. By having advance warning of severe weather events, emergency responders can be better equipped to save lives and minimize damage</p>
